            On the game page, three shapes will flash in a random sequence. After the flashing ends, your task is to click the shapes in the exact order they appeared.
            You have three chances to get it right. Don't forget that you have to click and choose the shapes patiently.
            The game will get progressively harder as you play.
            In more challenging rounds, you'll earn higher scores for successfully completing the sequence.
            Good luck and enjoy the game!
